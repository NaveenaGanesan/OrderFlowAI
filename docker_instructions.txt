# Instructions to Run Docker-Compose

1. Ensure Docker and Docker-Compose are installed on your system.
    - Verify installation by running:
      ```
      docker --version
      docker-compose --version
      ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```
    cd OrderFlowAI
    ```

3. Start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
    - Use the `-d` flag to run containers in detached mode:
      ```
      docker-compose up -d
      ```

4. To view running containers:
    ```
    docker-compose ps
    ```

5. To stop the services:
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

6. If you need to rebuild the images (e.g., after making changes to the Dockerfile):
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
7. For logs:
    ```
    docker-compose logs
    ```

8. For logs of a specific service:
    ```
    docker-compose logs <service_name>
    ```

    ```
    docker-compose logs elasticsearch
    ```

9. Remove volumes and start fresh(deletes data):

```bash
docker-compose down -v 
```

10. To scale a specific service:
    ```
    docker-compose up --scale <service_name>=<number_of_instances>
    ```

11. Clean up unused images, volumes, and networks:
    ```
    docker system prune
    ```
